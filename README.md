# Link My Ride

## A decentralized vehicle rental platform powered by Chainlink and Ethereum.

This repository consists of:

- [Tesla External Adapter](https://github.com/pappas999/Link-My-Ride/tree/master/src/Tesla-External-Adapter)

- [Mock Tesla API](https://github.com/pappas999/Link-My-Ride/tree/master/src/Teslamock)

- [Web App](https://github.com/pappas999/Link-My-Ride/tree/master/src/web-app)

## Architecture diagram

TODO - Add diagram

## If we had more time to take this proof of concept further we would...

- Ensure financial incentive for both vehicle owner and renter are sufficient to promote good behaviour

- Cover all essential insurance

- Use user's timezone (All times in the web app are currently UTC)

- Add form validation in web app

- Better responding to events emitted from smart contract in web app
