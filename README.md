## If we had more time to take this proof of concept further we would...

- Ensure financial incentive for both vehicle owner and renter are sufficient to promote good behaviour

- Add features to facilitate vehicle fleet management including reporting and analytics

- Expand to other API-enabled vehicles

- Cover all essential insurance

- Improve UI/UX (Form validation, responding to events emitted from smart contract, use user's timezone [currently all times in the web app are in UTC] and more)
